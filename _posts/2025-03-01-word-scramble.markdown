description: |
   WordScramble is an engaging word game that challenges players to create new words from a randomly selected 8-letter root word. Players can choose from different difficulty levels, ranging from easy to hard, with the more challenging levels featuring a timed component. As players create valid words, they earn points, with the game tracking the highest-scoring words and their best performance. Each game session includes multiple rounds, and the game tracks progress, providing a fun and competitive experience. The app also includes a game history feature to keep track of past sessions.
