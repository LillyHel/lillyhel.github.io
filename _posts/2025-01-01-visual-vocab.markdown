description: |
   This project is an interactive web application that allows users to improve their foreign language skills in a playful way. The application displays a 3D room where users are prompted to select specific objects. The goal is to find and click on the correct object in the room. A correct selection turns the object green, while an incorrect choice is marked in red.
